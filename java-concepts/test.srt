1
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.299
So before we leave this section I want

2
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:09.850
to show you the Kotlin read eval in

3
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.019
print loop, also known as the repl now

4
00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.209
maybe they say that as a repl, I don't

5
00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.720
know the repl lets you practice your

6
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.279
Kotlin and you can also use it to

7
00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.810
quickly check whether a code snippet

8
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.720
will work. So in IntelliJ you can get to

9
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.080
it by going to tools Kotlin and then

10
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.680
down to Kotlin repl here and you'll

11
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.940
notice that it opens up at the bottom

12
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.920
and there's a great outline here saying

13
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.230
ctrl + enter to execute remember that,

14
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.870
because you'll tend to hit enter

15
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.570
and then wonder why nothing is happening.

16
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.579
So now we can type any expression into

17
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.640
the repl and we hit ctrl enter and it

18
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.860
will be evaluated for us, so let's try

19
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.300
3 + 4 and we hit ctrl enter and we'll see

20
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.920
that 7 comes up and you'll notice that

21
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.289
there's an equal sign here so this is

22
00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.539
the result of the expression up here.

23
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.379
Let's try 5 minus 2 and the other way

24
00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.270
that we can execute an expression is

25
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.459
just to click the green run-button here,

26
00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:13.300
button rather and we'll see that we get 3,

27
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.399
Now, you'll notice that above the

28
00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.840
repl window it says in module

29
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.060
declarations, the repl knows about the

30
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.700
definitions in your project so we can

31
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.039
reference them. So for example we could

32
00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.190
start typing employee and it will

33
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.770
actually suggest the employee definition

34
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.950
that we have in our project. So let's go

35
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.420
back and type var employee 3 equals

36
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.619
employee give him the name John Doe and

37
00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.520
let's give him an ID of let's say 300.

38
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.360
Now, we have to declare our employee here

39
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.000
and then we'll import it into the repl.

40
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.429
Also, it's underlined employee 3 just as

41
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.899
it does in the editor, because it's

42
00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.849
mutable. Now we don't want to run yet

43
00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.920
because there's no expression here, we're

44
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.509
just doing an assignment statement.

45
00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.300
So we'll just go to then to the end of

46
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.340
the line press enter and then we'll say

47
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.430
well print line employee 3.

48
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.379
And at this point there is something we

49
00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.290
can do, so we'll hit ctrl enter and we'll

50
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.920
see that we get employee 3 printed.

51
00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.110
Now, because we're in the repl, we don't

52
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.379
actually have to use print line, so we

53
00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.709
can just type in employee 3 dot name for

54
00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.900
example and then hit ctrl enter and it

55
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.450
will print John Doe, so it kind of knows

56
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.489
that because you're in the repl, you

57
00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.859
want to see results and so it doesn't

58
00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.049
force you to actually type print line,

59
00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.400
but you can if you want.

60
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.010
So the repple knows about definitions in

61
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.720
your project, you do have to import them

62
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.909
but it's aware of them and it also knows

63
00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:57.310
about previous definitions you've made,

64
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.489
like for example once we declared

65
00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.989
employee 3 here, we didn't have to

66
00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.060
declare it again. Once we've used it we

67
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.709
can just go ahead and keep using it in

68
00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.230
this instance of the of the repl, so if

69
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.760
you want to play with some code, without

70
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.680
having to compile and run it, this is a

71
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.299
great way to do it and you know when

72
00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.370
you're first learning Kotlin, before you

73
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.730
type a long statement into your file, you

74
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.230
might want to try the repl and make

75
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.030
sure it's going to do what the

76
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.319
statements going to do, what you expect

77
00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:24.849
it to do. Now when you're finished

78
00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.829
playing, you can just press the red X on

79
00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.609
the left to stop and close the repl,

80
00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.560
if you don't want to close it, but you want

81
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.480
to clear what's there and rebuild your

82
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.060
project, you can just press the restart

83
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.669
button right here. So if we were to do

84
00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.060
that, it actually rebuilds our project

85
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.669
here and then it comes and says ok, I'm

86
00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.590
ready for action again or you can just

87
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.019
close it and I've got a couple of tabs

88
00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.299
open here, so I'll close them all and

89
00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.169
there we go, that's the Kotlin read eval

90
00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.180
print loop. I'll see you in the next video.
